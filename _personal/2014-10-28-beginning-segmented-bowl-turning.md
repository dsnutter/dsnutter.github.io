Segmented rings are used in woodturning to produce vessels that are made
up of many different types and pieces of woods. There are a lot of
different segmented design configurations possible, but in this post I
will describe a method of making a basic segmented ring that can be
duplicated and then used to create a simple segmented bowl with three of
these basic segmented rings.

Design
------

The segmented rings we are designing take the shape of a 12 sided
polygon with alternating color pieces that approximate a circle. When
turning this ring on a wood lathe the 12 sided polygon becomes circular,
and can form a section of a bowl, vase, or other round vessel. With the
style of ring described we are going to make a cherry and oak bowl
consisting of three of the described 6 1/2″ diameter rings stacked
vertically with a solid cherry bottom.

We will need to know the length of each of the small segments that makes
up the ring, the width of the pieces which determines the initial width
of the ring at its location in the bowl, and the angle at which to cut
each of the pieces so they form the 12 sided polygon. To determine the
length of each piece of a 6 1/2″ diameter ring, use [the segmented bowl
ring
calculator](http://measuredwoodworks.com/segmented-bowl-ring-calculator "Segmented Bowl Ring calculator"),
or find the circumference of the ring and divide that by the total
number of segments in the ring:

> Circumference = PI \* diameter
>
> Segment Length = Circumference / Number of Segments

So, the circumference is (3.14159 \* 6.5) = 20.420335. And the Segment
Length is (20.420335 / 12) = 1.70169 which is approximately 1 11/16″.
Note that if we follow these measurements the unturned bowl will be 6
1/2″ in diameter. Note that turning the bowl makes the finished bowl
smaller than 6 1/2″, and ours ended up being 6″ after turning.

Since the design is an alternating segment design, we will need 6 oak
segments and 6 cherry segments for each ring. There are three rings
needed, so…3 rings \* 6 segments oak per ring = 18 segments oak, and 3
rings \* 6 segments cherry per ring = 18 segments of cherry. So we will
need 18 segments of oak and 18 segments of cherry, or 36 segments total,
with each of the segments having a segment length of 1 11/16″.

The wood we will need to create the segmented rings will be 3/4″ thick x
1.5″ wide x 37″ long cherry and 3/4″ thick x 1.5″ wide x 37″ oak. I
added on approximately 6″ in extra wood length so that there is enough
extra wood to hold onto when using a miter saw to cut the segments.

Step \#1: Cutting
-----------------

Use a miter saw to cut the segment pieces from the wood stock.

We want to have 12 segments in a ring, so we will use a 15 degree cut
angle. See the [Segmented Bowl Ring Cut Angles Chart](http://measuredwoodworks.com/segmented-bowl-ring-cut-angles-chart.php" Segmented Bowl Ring Cut Angles Chart") for the cut angle.

Step \#2: Gluing Rings
----------------------

Glue up the segmented ring with wood glue and hose clamps.

![Flattening rings - Beginning Segmented Bowl Turning]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/Simple_7.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

Step \#3: Flattening Rings
--------------------------

Make the rings have flat tops and bottoms.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

![Flattening rings - Beginning Segmented Bowl Turning]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/Simple_8.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

For sanding the rings flat, some people use a segmented ring hot glued
to a faceplate on a lathe, and use a large flat board w/sandpaper glued
to it to flatten the ring, or flatten the ring using turning tools.
Also, some people flatten rings using a large disc sander – but I
flatten the rings using a drum sander.

Step \#4: Cutting Bottom
------------------------

Cut a 6 3/4″ width x 6 3/4″ length x 1″ thick solid cherry bottom for
the bowl.

![Gluing vertically - Beginning Segmented Bowl Turning]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/Simple_13.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

Step \#5: Gluing Vertically
---------------------------

Glue and stack the bottom and the rings vertically.

Step \#6: Attach Faceplate
--------------------------

Glue a faceplate onto bowl bottom.

![Rough turn the bowl - Beginning Segmented Bowl Turning]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/Simple_15.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

Step \#7: Rough turn the bowl
-----------------------------

Turn the bowl with a bowl gouge and scaper on both the inside and
outside of the bowl. Note that we are using a bowl gouge because the
solid bottom of the bowl is a cross grained turning. Also, if you have a
bandsaw, you can cut the corners off of the bottom piece so that you
have less material to turn away.

![Sanding - Beginning Segmented Bowl Turning]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/Simple_21.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

Step \#8: Sanding
-----------------

Sand bowl by hand or with homemade or purchased drill sanding pads to
speed up sanding process. I sand progressively from rough grit to
smoother grit, using 120, 220, and 400 grit, trying to eliminate any
tool marks or scratches. You may need to experiment sanding with the
lathe on and off or sand with the grain (such as on the inside bottom of
the bowl) to get all scratches and tool marks out of the bowl.

Step \#9: Filling voids
-----------------------

Fill any chips or voids in the bowl with wood glue mixed with sawdust,
and sand the bowl again until all the scratches and tool marks are gone.

![Finishing - Beginning Segmented Bowl Turning]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/Simple_25.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

Step \#10: Finishing
--------------------

Put finish on the bowl. Sand with 400 grit between coats. I use multiple
coats of Minwax fast drying gloss polyurethane for my segmented bowls.
The polyurethane is not food safe, but gives the bowl a bright, hard,
and clear finish.

That’s it. The process of creating a simple segmented bowl is achievable
by anyone with bowl gouge experience and a little practice. Creating a
segmented bowl is a great option if you have access to flat 3/4″ wood
stock and not chunks of wood for a solid wood bowl. An advantage of a
segmented vs. a solid wood bowl is that a solid wood bowl is typically
rough turned with green wood, then put aside for months or years for the
wood to fully dry, and then the bowl is turned again to completion. With
a segmented bowl blank being made out of dry wood, once the bowl is
turned, it can be completed in a shorter time frame.
