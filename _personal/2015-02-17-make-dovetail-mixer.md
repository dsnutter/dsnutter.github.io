This post describes how to make a dovetail mixer, also known as a
bull grinder or do nothing.

As the handle of the dovetail mixer is moved circularly, the walnut
pistons in the dovetail grooves in the base move back and forth.

Tools/Materials
---------------

-   Length of 3 1/2 x 10″ x 3/4″ piece of cherry
-   Length of scrap 1/2″ thick walnut
-   Length of 4″ x 3/8″ x 1/4″ piece of cherry
-   Length of 1/2″ oak dowel
-   Wood screws: (2) \#6 x 5/8″ and (1) \#6 x 1/2″
-   Bandsaw
-   Router table with router
-   1/4″ straight router bit
-   1/2″ dovetail router bit
-   Disc sander
-   Random orbital or palm sander
-   Drill and drill bits
-   Mineral oil

Step \#1: Rout grooves for the dovetail mixer base
--------------------------------------------------

Using a router table, cut a groove 3/8″ deep with a 1/4″ straight bit in
a 3 1/2″ x 10″ 3/4″ piece of cherry. First rout a groove cross grain,
and then rout a groove with the grain. Use a backer board when routing
against the grain to prevent tearout. Then change the router bit to a
1/2″ dovetail bit, and rout at the same height and in the same places
you routed with the straight bit.

We did not use a dovetail bit to rout the entire piece. The wood routs
with less tear out and a cleaner cut when part of the dovetail groove is
already routed away using the straight bit.

Step \#2: Trim the routed base
------------------------------

Trim the bases routed in Step \#1 with a bandsaw or tablesaw. Cut the
bases to 3″ x 3″. In the picture I am making more than one base at a
time, so in Step \#1 I cut multiple cross grain grooves, and one groove
with the grain.

Step \#3: Cut the pistons
-------------------------

Take a length of scrap 1/2″ thick walnut at least 4″ long and cut it at
a 30 degree angle on the bandsaw. The piston tops will be approximately
1/4″ in width, and the pistons have a trapezoidal shape.

![Sand the pistons - Make a Dovetail Mixer]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/DovetailMixer_8.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

Step \#4: Sand the pistons and cut to length
--------------------------------------------

Sand the piston sides with a disc sander at 90 degrees to the bottom of
the piston and sand at the same angle as the side of the pistons until
the pistons fit in the base’s grooves and slide in the grooves easily.
Cut the pistons to 1 1/2″ in length.

Step \#5: Make the piston arms
------------------------------

Cut a piece of 4″ x 3/8″ x 1/4″ cherry for the piston arms, and round
the ends of the arm using a disc sander.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

![Drill the pistons and arms - Make a Dovetail Mixer]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/DovetailMixer_11.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

Step \#6: Drill the pistons and piston arms
-------------------------------------------

Drill two holes in the piston arm 1 1/2″ apart (or to length of your
pistons if they are not 1 1/2″), with one hole near one end of the arm.
The holes must be bigger in diameter than the \#6 x 5/8″ screws so that
the screws are loose. Then drill a hole near the other end of the arm
for the arm handle. Countersink the piston holes on the top of the arm
to fit the head of the screws, and countersink the hole on the bottom of
the arm for the arm handle screw. Then drill in the center of the top of
the 1 1/2″ pistons with a 1/16″ drill bit.

Step \#7: Sand and cut the handle
---------------------------------

Round over the top of the 1/2″ dowel handle at an angle with a disc
sander.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

![Cut the handle - Make a Dovetail Mixer]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/DovetailMixer_14.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

Cut the dowel handle to 1/2″ in height using a bandsaw.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

![Drill the handle - Make a Dovetail Mixer]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/DovetailMixer_15.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

Step \#8: Drill the handle
--------------------------

Drill a 1/16″ hole in the bottom of the center of the 1/2″ dowel handle.

![Apply finish - Make a Dovetail Mixer]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/DovetailMixer_17.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

Step \#9: Apply finish
----------------------

Apply a non-toxic mineral oil finish to all parts and let the parts dry.
Make sure to get enough mineral oil in the dovetail grooves of the base.

Step \#10: Assembly
-------------------

Assemble the dovetail mixer with the screws. Make sure that the screws
are not so tight that the piston arm and dowel handle cannot spin and
move freely.

Done!:
------

We are finished! Completed project is at the right.
