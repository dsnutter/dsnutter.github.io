This post explains the process of making a simple side table.

Tools/Materials
---------------

-   Lengths of red oak, white oak, and cherry
-   Miter saw
-   Drum sander, planer, or random orbital sander
-   Bandsaw
-   Jointer or wood plane
-   Router table and roundover bit
-   Bar or Pipe Clamps
-   Pocket hole jig and screws
-   Satin Polyurethane

Step \#1: Cut Wood to Width and Length
--------------------------------------

Using a tablesaw or bandsaw, cut

-   Eight 0.75" x 1.5" x 25" lengths of white oak to be glued up for the
    legs
-   Two 0.75" x 3.25" x 10" for lengths white oak for the left and right
    sides
-   Two 0.75" x 3.25" x 15" lengths white oak for the front and back
    sides
-   Two 0.75" x 6" x 20.25" lengths of white oak for the top
-   Two 0.75" x 1.25" x 20.25" lengths of cherry for the top
-   One 0.75" x 0.75" x 20.25" length of red oak for the top

Step \#2: Make the legs
-----------------------

Glueup the legs by gluing two lengths of 0.75" x 1.5" x 25" of white oak
so that the legs are 1.5" square.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

![Joint the legs - Making a Simple Side Table]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/MakingSimpleSideTable_2.JPG){:.pull-right .caption}

After gluing up the leg blanks, joint the legs square.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

![Taper the legs - Making a Simple Side Table]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/MakingSimpleSideTable_4.JPG){:.pull-right .caption}

Saw a taper on the bandsaw from 0.75" wide on one end of the legs to the
edge of the leg 15" from the end where the cut was started.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

![Remove bandsaw marks - Making a Simple Side Table]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/MakingSimpleSideTable_5.JPG){:.pull-right .caption}

Sand or joint the taper to remove any bandsaw marks.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

![Drill holes with pocket jig - Making a Simple Side Table]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/MakingSimpleSideTable_6.JPG){:.pull-right .caption}

Step \#3: Make the table frame
------------------------------

Drill holes for assembling the table's frame with a pocket hole jig.
There must be two holes for every joint where the sides meet the legs,
and pocket holes in the upper length of the sides to attach the table
top.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

![Add Pocket Screws - Making a Simple Side Table]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/MakingSimpleSideTable_7.JPG){:.pull-right .caption}

Do NOT do what I did and only add one pocket hole per leg joint. If you
do, you will probably have trouble assembling the table due to the side
rotating around the pocket screw, so use two pocket holes per side for
leg joints.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

Add the pocket screws to build the table frame. I would also suggest
using a rafter's square to clamp the legs and sides squarely for the
frame assembly. Screw the sides flush with the outer sides of the legs.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

Step \#4: Create the tabletop
-----------------------------

Glueup the tabletop with some bar or pipe clamps. The tabletop wood
order I used is white oak, cherry, red oak, cherry, white oak. After the
glue is dry, use a drum sander, planer, or palm sander to flatten the
tabletop and remove any glue squeezeout or unevenness.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

![Trim tabletop - Making a Simple Side Table]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/MakingSimpleSideTable_15.JPG){:.pull-right .caption}

Using bandsaw, tablesaw, or a circular saw and a guide, trim the
tabletop to a length of 20".

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

![Roundover edges of tabletop - Making a Simple Side Table]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/MakingSimpleSideTable_16.JPG){:.pull-right .caption}

Place the tabletop face down and roundover the edges of the tabletop
with a router table fitted with a roundover bit.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

Attach the tabletop to the table frame using screws and the pocket holes
you drilled for the top when creating the sides. Center the tabletop
relative to the frame, and leave overhang on all sides.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

![Satin polyurethane - Making a Simple Side Table]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/MakingSimpleSideTable_21.JPG){:.pull-right .caption}

Step \#5: Sanding and Finishing
-------------------------------

Sand the entire table from 120 grit all the way up to 400 grit, removing
all sanding marks, scratches, and blemishes as you go along. After
sanding, wipe the table down with a soft cloth loaded with satin
polyurethane. Sand in between coats with 400 grit sandpaper, and add a
total of three coats.

Done!

This is the first piece of furniture I have built, and my goal was to
keep it simple to make. There are many other variations you could make
on this design, such as adding a drawer or adding a shelf midway up the
legs. The tools that I used to make the table may not be available in
every shop, but there is always a simpler tool that can be substituted
for what I used. For example, a bandsaw could be used instead of a
tablesaw. A palm sander, wood plane, or a planer could be used in place
of a drum sander.

I hope you find this article useful, and I encourage you to try out this
design. I know I learned a lot from making this simple side table, and I
hope you do too!
