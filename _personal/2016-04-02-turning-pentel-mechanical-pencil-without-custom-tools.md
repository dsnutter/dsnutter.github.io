This article explains how to turn a custom barrel for a Pentel
mechanical pencil mechanism without using custom one purpose jigs or
tools.

The Pentel mechanism used is commonly called a Pentel 205 (0.5mm lead),
Pentel 207 (0.7mm lead), or Pentel Sharp.

### How It Works

The holes through the mechanical pencil barrel blank we are building go
from big to small, and the small side acts as a wall the pentel
mechanism braces against to advance the lead in the mechanism. The
mechanism is held fast in the blank by having the screw threads of the
writing end stick out of the end of the blank with the tip of the
mechanism screwed on securing the mechanism to the wood cylinder.

### Tools and Materials Needed

-   Pentel 205 or Pentel 207 mechanical pencil. Also known as Pentel
    Sharp Mechanical Pencil.
-   Lathe
-   Lathe chuck and small chuck jaws to fit your lathe
-   Drill chuck
-   Sandpaper (100, 220, & 400 grit)
-   Minwax Polyurethane
-   4.5” to 5” long x 3/4” x 3/4” piece of wood (these are
    minimum dimensions)
-   Bandsaw
-   Drill bits
    -   5/32” bit
    -   1/4” bit standard length
    -   1/4” bit 6” or 12” length
    -   5/16” bit

### Step \#1: Cut the blank to size

The mechanical pencil wood blank should be at least 4.5” to 5” long x
3/4” x 3/4”. I made mine about 7” long, and approximately 1” x 1”
square. The more wood you have above the minimum dimensions, the more
you will have to turn or cut down to the size you will need. I try to
make the finished wood cylinder beefier than a slimline or other custom
pen, because the mechanical pencil design I am describing does not have
a brass tube down the center like purchasable pen kits do. I cut the
blank to size on a bandsaw.

### Step \#2: Rough turn the blank

Rough turn the wood blank between centers down to a cylinder and cut
down the cylinder on the bandsaw to 1/4" longer than the original
plastic mechanical pencil barrel we are replacing.

### Step \#3: Turn the round blank to shape

Using the small jaws on a four jaw woodturning chuck, turn the blank
down to a small size on one end (the writing part) and a thicker size on
the other end (the non-writing end). You will have to rechuck the blank
in reverse to do each end of the blank. Use the tail cone to roughly
center the blank in the chuck so that the blank remains circular when
turned.

### Step \#4: Drill the writing end

With the blank centered in the 4 jaw chuck, drill a 5/32” hole in the
writing end of the blank 1/4” deep. I used blue tape placed 1/4” from
the end of the bit to drill to the appropriate depth.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

![Drill the non-writing end - Turning Pentel Mechanical Pencils Without Custom Tools]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/Pentel205_7.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

### Step \#5: Drill the non-writing end

Compare the blank you turned to shape to a 1/4" standard length drill
bit to see how far it will drill through the blank. It is likely it will
not drill all the way through. If so, drill the blank to the maximum
depth of the 1/4" standard drill bit using the drill chuck.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

![Drill the non-writing end with a longer bit - Turning Pentel Mechanical Pencils Without Custom Tools]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/Pentel205_9.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

### Step \#6: Drill the non-writing end with a longer bit

Switch the drill bit to a 6" or 12" 1/4" drill bit and drill all of the
way until the holes from the writing end of the blank almost meets the
hole from the non-writing end of the blank. The reason we do not drill
the 1/4" hole all the way to meet the 5/32" hole is that redrilling the
5/32" from the writing side offers an opportunity to better control the
width of the stop formed that advances the lead with the Pentel
mechanism. Remember to compare the 6" or 12" drill bit to the blank and
affix blue tape to indicate the depth you should drill to. The reason we
used the 1/4" standard drill bit first is because the long drill bit in
the drill chuck has a tendency to wander from the center of rotation
because of its long length. The previous 1/4" standard drill bit hole
centers the longer 1/4" drill bit and keeps it from wandering into an
elliptical path instead of a straight one.

### Step \#7: Drill the holes to meet

Switch the blank with the writing end towards the tailstock and center
the blank with the tail cone. Rechuck the 5/32” bit and drill to meet
the 1/4” hole in the non-writing end. This will form a stop that the
Pentel mechanism braces against to advance the lead.

![Expand the hole in the writing end - Turning Pentel Mechanical Pencils Without Custom Tools]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/Pentel205_11.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

### Step \#8: Expand the hole in non-writing end

We need to expand the hole in the non-writing end to accomodate the
metal eraser cap on the Pentel mechanism. Chuck up the blank with the
non-writing end towards the tailstock and center it with the tail cone.
Use a 5/16” bit to drill a hole 1/4” deep to fit the cap on the
non-writing end.

![Test fit the mechanism and adjust - Turning Pentel Mechanical Pencils Without Custom Tools]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/Pentel205_12.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

### Step \#9: Test fit the mechanism and adjust

Test fit the Pentel mechanism in the barrel you created for a test
fitting. If necessary, cut enough off of the writing end with the
bandsaw so that the threads on the writing end show, but don't cut off
enough that the wood stop that advances the Pentel mechanism is removed.
I ended up cutting off about 1/8", but it will all depend on how long
you decided your blank should be and how far you drilled the holes in
from each side of the barrel.

![Sand the barrel - Turning Pentel Mechanical Pencils Without Custom Tools]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/Pentel205_15.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

### Step \#10: Sand the barrel

Sand the barrel to final size through increasing grits of 100, 220, &
400 grit sandpaper.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

### Step \#11: Apply Finish

You can use any finish you want. Some people use superglue or Hut
friction polish, but I used a simple 6 coat finish of Minwax
polyurethane. I sanded with 400 grit after each successive polyurethane
coat.
