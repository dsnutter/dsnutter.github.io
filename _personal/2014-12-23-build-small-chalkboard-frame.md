This article describes how to build a small challkboard frame.

Materials/Tools needed:
-----------------------

-   Router
-   Router bits: 1/8″ straight, 1/4″ ovolo, 1/4″ roundover
-   Miter/Chop saw
-   4 corner strap clamp
-   Pocket screw jig
-   \(8) 1 1/4″ screws
-   \(2) 7″ x 5″ x 1/8″ MDF chalkboards
-   Glue
-   Wood: 3/4″ x 3/4″ x 60″ for the frame
-   Wood 3/4″ x 2″ x 16 1/4″ for the chalk tray

Design
------

I bought two 7″ x 5″ x 1/8″ MDF chalkboards at a local thrift store, and
I decided to make a frame for the chalkboards with a chalk tray. The
frame is made out of scrap fir that was saved from the recycle heap when
a house was remodeled. The two small chalkboards will be combined into
one frame instead of two separate frames. I decided the total frame
dimensions would be 6 1/4″ height x 16 1/4″ width so that the small
chalkboards could be framed side by side.

Step \#1: Rout the chalkboard dado
----------------------------------

Rout a dado the entire length of the fir for the frame with a 1/8″
straight router bit set at 1/8″ in height. I used a router table and a
[router bit height
gauge](http://measuredwoodworks.com/making-router-bit-height-gauge/ "Making a router bit height gauge")
to do this. I put the fir up against the router fence configured with
the dado halfway between the edges of the width of the fir.

Step \#2: Miter cut the wood
----------------------------

Cut the fir to length on a miter saw. For the outside edges of the
frame, you will need the fir to be mitered at 45 degrees. The pieces
needed are 3/4″ x 3/4″ x 16 1/4″ for the top and bottom of the frame,
and 3/4″ x 3/4″ x 6 1/4″ for the left and right sides of the frame.
There are also two middle pieces of the frame that are cut straight
across at zero degrees with no miter that need to be 3/4″ x 3/4″ x 4
3/4″ each.

Step \#3: Dry assemble the frame
--------------------------------

Dry assemble the frame to see if all the pieces fit. If they do not,
trim off small sections of the fir pieces until they fit properly.

Step \#4: Drill pocket screw holes
----------------------------------

Drill pocket screw holes in the middle pieces.

<div class="pull-reset"></div>

![Secure middle pieces - Build a small chalkboard frame]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/SmallChalkboardFrame_8.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

Step \#5: Secure the middle pieces
----------------------------------

Secure the middle pieces with pocket screws, attaching the two middle
pieces to the top and bottom of the frame. Hold the frame parts square
by dry assembling the frame and putting it in a four corner strap clamp
before driving the screws in.

![Glue up frame - Build a small chalkboard frame]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/SmallChalkboardFrame_9.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

Step \#6: Glue up the frame
---------------------------

Glue up the frame parts and put the frame in a four corner strap clamp
to dry.

Step \#7: Rout a chalk tray
---------------------------

Cut a length of fir 16 1/4″ x 2″ x 3/4″ for the chalk tray and rout a
groove in the tray 1″ from the side of the wood to hold chalk. I used an
1/4″ ovolo bit because it was what I had on hand, but any bit that
provides a wide enough groove to keep the chalk from rolling around
would work. I used blue tape and fence stop blocks to approximate where
to start and stop the routing so that the groove did not extend the
entire length of the tray.

On the router table, I then used a 1/4″ roundover bit on the front and
side edges of the tray.

![Attach chalk tray - Build a small chalkboard frame]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/SmallChalkboardFrame_12.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

Step \#8 Attach chalk tray
--------------------------

Attach the chalk tray to the frame by predrilling and countersinking
holes that go through the bottom of the tray into the frame. Drive
screws into the holes to secure the chalk tray.

![Spray finish - Build a small chalkboard frame]({{ site.DSN.imagePathPersonal }}/SmallChalkboardFrame_15.jpg){:.pull-right .caption}

Step \#9: Spray finish on the chalkboard frame
----------------------------------------------

Mask off the chalkboards with blue tape to prepare for a spray finish on
the frame.

I used Deft sanding sealer and clear finish. First, sand all parts of
the frame. Spray on the sanding sealer, wait 10 minutes, and then sand
the small chalkboard frame with 400 grit sandpaper. Spray on the clear
finish, wait 10 minutes, and sand with 400 grit sandpaper. I used three
coats of the Deft clear finish, sanding after each coat.
